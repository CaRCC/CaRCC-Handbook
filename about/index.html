<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-carcc">What is CaRCC?</h2>
<p>CaRCC – the Campus Research Computing Consortium – is an organization of dedicated professionals developing, advocating for, and advancing campus <strong>research computing and data</strong>* and associated professions. Major activities include building community among research computing and data professionals (see the <a href="/people-network">People Network</a>, and a number of interest and working groups around community-driving priorities related to professionalization and workforce development, institutional assessment and strategy, connecting the broader research computing and data ecosystem, and defining stakeholders and shared value propositions for the community at a time of accelerating change.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CaRCC-Charter.pdf">CaRCC Charter</a> defines the following Vision and Mission:</p>
<p><strong>Vision:</strong> CaRCC advances the frontiers of research by improving the effectiveness of research computing and data (RCD) professionals, including their career development and visibility, and their ability to deliver services and resources for researchers. CaRCC connects RCD professionals and organizations around common objectives to increase knowledge sharing and enable continuous innovation in research computing and data capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Mission:</strong> CaRCC communities, working groups, and our collaborating partners, advance innovation and sustainability of RCD at academic, government, and non-profit institutions. CaRCC communities connect professionals across RCD roles and organizations, including those who design and operate systems, those who work with software and data, and those who engage directly with researchers. CaRCC working groups explore and develop effective strategies, leading practices, and products that empower researchers across campuses, and at regional, national, and international scales.</p>
<p>CaRCC is continuously evolving and open to <a href="/how-to-join">new ideas</a>. Get involved! Current areas of high priority, based on survey results and discussions among participants, include the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>CI workforce development and professionalization.</li>
<li>Defining stakeholders and value propositions for the CI, research computing and data communities, broadly defined.</li>
<li>Understanding the current state and future roadmap for advocation, support, and sustainability of research computing on campuses and beyond.</li>
<li>Development of <a href="/products">products</a> that help define, support, and steward the profession of research computing and data on campuses.</li>
<li>Connecting the national community of research computing and data professionals and promoting various facing roles, such as researcher-facing, systems-facing, stakeholder-facing, and software/data-facing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CaRCC has also referred to (reflecting history and origin):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The funded <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1620695">NSF RCN award OAC-1620695</a> (PI: Jim Bottum) “RCN: Advancing Research and Education through a national network of campus research computing infrastructures – The CaRC Consortium”, which begot the consortium.</li>
<li>An extension of the <a href="http://aciref.org/">ACI-REF</a>** experiment, a group of campuses who banded together in an attempt to figure out how to sustain and maintain the massive growth in demand for research computing by coordinating around common researcher-facing service methodologies to develop best practices.</li>
<li>A virtual organization of committed people working to provide products that help to advance research computing and data, such as helping to define the profession, to bring communities together, and to understand the common challenges and future needs of research computing and data, broadly defined.</li>
</ul>

<p>* “Research computing and data” involves people, scholarship, and resources supporting the IT specific to research and scholarship leveraging compute, data, networking, and software, broadly defined, including the professionals who execute and support these efforts. Whereas entities supporting research computing and data historically emerged from operating and supporting high performance computing, the needs, capabilities and technologies have sufficiently broadened the scope of research information technology to include virtualization, support for the cloud, containers, middleware, workflows, data management, data movement, compliance and security, user training, support of instruction using advanced research computing and data, on-boarding into new technologies, and deep engagement (“facilitation”) to help guide researchers. Check out results from our 2022 survey of the community in “Who We (RCD Professionals) Are“.</p>
