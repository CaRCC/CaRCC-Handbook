CaRCC \u2013 the Campus Research Computing Consortium \u2013 is an organization of dedicated professionals developing, advocating for, and advancing campus research computing and data * and associated professions. Major activities include building community among research computing and data professionals (see the People Network , and a number of interest and working groups around community-driving priorities related to professionalization and workforce development, institutional assessment and strategy, connecting the broader research computing and data ecosystem, and defining stakeholders and shared value propositions for the community at a time of accelerating change. The CaRCC Charter defines the following Vision and Mission: Vision: CaRCC advances the frontiers of research by improving the effectiveness of research computing and data (RCD) professionals, including their career development and visibility, and their ability to deliver services and resources for researchers. CaRCC connects RCD professionals and organizations around common objectives to increase knowledge sharing and enable continuous innovation in research computing and data capabilities. Mission: CaRCC communities, working groups, and our collaborating partners, advance innovation and sustainability of RCD at academic, government, and non-profit institutions. CaRCC communities connect professionals across RCD roles and organizations, including those who design and operate systems, those who work with software and data, and those who engage directly with researchers. CaRCC working groups explore and develop effective strategies, leading practices, and products that empower researchers across campuses, and at regional, national, and international scales. CaRCC is continuously evolving and open to new ideas . Get involved! Current areas of high priority, based on survey results and discussions among participants, include the following areas: CI workforce development and professionalization. Defining stakeholders and value propositions for the CI, research computing and data communities, broadly defined. Understanding the current state and future roadmap for advocation, support, and sustainability of research computing on campuses and beyond. Development of products that help define, support, and steward the profession of research computing and data on campuses. Connecting the national community of research computing and data professionals and promoting various facing roles, such as researcher-facing, systems-facing, stakeholder-facing, and software/data-facing. CaRCC has also referred to (reflecting history and origin): The funded NSF RCN award OAC-1620695 (PI: Jim Bottum) \u201cRCN: Advancing Research and Education through a national network of campus research computing infrastructures \u2013 The CaRC Consortium\u201d, which begot the consortium. An extension of the ACI-REF ** experiment, a group of campuses who banded together in an attempt to figure out how to sustain and maintain the massive growth in demand for research computing by coordinating around common researcher-facing service methodologies to develop best practices. A virtual organization of committed people working to provide products that help to advance research computing and data, such as helping to define the profession, to bring communities together, and to understand the common challenges and future needs of research computing and data, broadly defined.

This guide provides an overview of these resources and a brief historical context. The following resources are considered foundational or must-reads for those interested in RCD Professionalization. Research Computing and Data Professionals Job Elements and Career Guide 1 : A detailed description of the RCD Facings. This is an early document in the history of RCD, however much of it remains relevant today. Note: since the release of this document, the facings have been updated to have distinct software facing and data facing roles. RCD Ecosystem Fostering Collaboration Among Organizations in the Research Computing and Data Ecosystem 2 The widespread application and success of computational and data intensive research approaches in every discipline represented on our campuses has resulted in a rapid proliferation of organizations, technologies, and professions affiliated in different ways with the support and advancement of activities related to research computing and data (RCD). While most agree that this growth is helping to advance numerous disciplines, the proliferation of organizations seeking to support, promote, and advance RCD has led to some challenges. Specifically, a lack of understanding and consensus concerning which organizations should be considered a part of RCD support hampers our ability to encourage collaborations among its complementary constituents, leads to unneeded and redundant activities, and makes it difficult to identify strategic priorities and address gaps where specific needs are not being met to advance various disciplinary activities. In this paper we introduce the ecosystem metaphor to help characterize the rapidly changing relationships among the growing set of organizations that in some way support and enable activities related to RCD. The ecosystem concept lends itself well to describing the many entities related to RCD because it emphasizes the larger system over its individual component parts and highlights their interdependence, while explicitly expecting their change over time. Our work to characterize the current RCD ecosystem, while imperfect, will serve as a foundation and framework for the development of a more complete view of the ever-changing RCD ecosystem. A more complete view of the RCD ecosystem will in turn help to advance the broad goals of its members by helping to foster and accelerate new and meaningful collaborations among them. Professionalization Research Computing and Data Professionals Job Elements and Career Guide 1 The guide provides a framework for the work of research computing and data professionals operating in universities, government labs, and other research-intensive settings.
